Compiling
---------

This is meant to be compiled as sub-project.

Include 'ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(rrs-server)' to 'code/CMakeLists.txt' file and copy these sources there or use symlink.

cmake option WITH_BMSITE_RRS=ON must be enabled.

Example

	cmake <ryzom-sources-path>/code \
		-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_BMSITE_RRS=ON \
		-DWITH_STATIC=ON -DWITH_STATIC_DRIVERS=ON \
		-DWITH_RYZOM_TOOLS=OFF -DWITH_RYZOM_SERVER=OFF -DWITH_RYZOM_CLIENT=OFF \
		-DWITH_NEL_TOOLS=OFF -DWITH_NEL_SAMPLES=OFF -DWITH_NEL_TESTS=OFF \
		-DWITH_LOGIC=OFF -DWITH_PACS=OFF -DWITH_SOUND=OFF -DWITH_GUI=OFF

Compiling in clean virtual machine (ubuntu 12.04 precise) requires packages

	build-essential cmake mercurial libxml2-dev libfreetype6-dev
	libpng12-0-dev libgl1-mesa-swx11-dev

And sources from [RyzomCore](https://bitbucket.org/ryzom/ryzomcore)

Running
-------

Running in virtual machine (ubuntu 12.04 precise) requires packages

	vnc4server libgl1-mesa-swx11 libxml2 libfreetype6 libpng12-0

If there is a need for window manager, then `blackbox` is nice and small.

Start vnc server normally ('vncserver' from command line). You can then modify
$HOME/.vnc/xstartup script to run 'rrs-server.sh'.

Example scripts to download .bnp files and run service are in 'bin' directory

Using
-----

There is php client avaiable from [here](https://github.com/nimetu/rrs_client.git).
